As an Eclipse user I've always been trouble by the lackluster support of SBT in Eclipse. In order to combat this problem, I forked [sbt-eclipse-plugin](http://github.com/frank06/sbt-eclipse-plugin) and added more features and improved the code. That project later became stale and now I'm concentrating my effort on [SBT Eclipse Integration](http://www.assembla.com/spaces/sbt-eclipse-integration); also known as SBTEI or SEI.

SBTEI has been stalled for a while as I've been busy with non-Scala projects. However, I'll be resuming my work in the near future. I still dream of being able to do this:

1.  Clone a project from source code repository
2.  Import it to Eclipse
3.  Start coding!

This incredibly easy and fast workflow works in Maven, so I'm wondering why Eclipse/SBT/Scala users aren't really interested in the same thing. Or maybe all Eclipse users have already been lost to Intellij IDEA?
